# Pandas-challenge

## Summary
In this challenge, we analysed data from high schools. We mainly focused the analysis on the average passing grades for reading, maths, and overall per school to categorise the school's performances based on different categories such as type (Government or Independent), its budget, and number of students.

As part of the analysis, data frames are showing the top and bottom school's performances based on their overall passing scores.

Furthermore, maths and reading average scores were categorised per school and year to analyse the school's performances per year.

Finally, there are three data frames to analyse schools by different characteristics. One data frame shows the average performance depending on the assigned budget per student. A second data frame shows the average performance depending on the number of students. The third data frame shows the average performance of schools depending on their type.

## Conclusions
1. Scores by School Spending data frame show that average schools' performances are inversely proportional to the budget per student dedicated per school. This would indicate that just dedicating more money per student is not a guarantee of improving the average performance of the school.

2. Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing), Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing), and Scores by School Type show that Independent schools consistently have better performance compared to Government schools. 3 of the top-5 best-performing schools (60%) are Independent and just 1 of the top-5 worst-performing schools are Independent. In the same way, the Overall average passing score of Independent schools is better than Government schools.
